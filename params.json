It is a complete ground up rewrite of the orignal plugin last released: 2012-5-31 (v0.3).\r\n\r\nThe plugin was originally written by [Marcus Kober](http://profiles.wordpress.org/marcuskober/) as a client implmentation.\r\n\r\n> For one of my customers I had to assign two featured images to pages. One featured image was used as the header image and the other as a small button for the submenu. The images had to be different too (so I couldn't simply use different images sizes) and so I wrote this little plugin. - [Marcus Kober](http://profiles.wordpress.org/marcuskober/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
