#### History
This is a fork and feature enhancement of [Multiple Featured Image](http://wordpress.org/plugins/multiple-featured-images/) from the WordPress.org plugin repo. It is a complete ground up rewrite of the orignal plugin last released: 2012-5-31 (v0.3).

The plugin was originally written by [Marcus Kober](http://profiles.wordpress.org/marcuskober/) as a client implmentation.

> For one of my customers I had to assign two featured images to pages. One featured image was used as the header image and the other as a small button for the submenu. The images had to be different too (so I couldn't simply use different images sizes) and so I wrote this little plugin. - [Marcus Kober](http://profiles.wordpress.org/marcuskober/)
